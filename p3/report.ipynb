    "> ## Bella Napoli - Naples, Italy\n",
    "> Author: Shawn P Emhe II\n",
    "\n",
    "I have lived in the Naples area for a significant portion of my adult life. Originally dubbed Neapolis, or New City by the ancient Greeks, Naples is anything but. The tight winding streets and dense population should provide interesting challenges for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Running audits on the Naples area dataset revealed several obstacles that needed to be worked through before the data could be wrangled into a MongoDB database. These problems ranged from the wide array of street types used in the region, inconsistent capitalization by map contributors and over abbrevations in street names. There were even conflicts in the way contributors tagged the city's most famous gastrnomical contribution.  In addition, Italy has several different phone formats making phone number validation a feat of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "An audit module was used to audit the file and find errors in the data."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "### Street Names\n",
    "The Italian format for street names places the street type at the begining of the name. In some situations the street names are also prefaced with a Roman numeral to indicate cadence. Small traversal streets frequently use this syntax. For example, \"III Traversa Pisciarella\" indicates that the road is the thrid street to cross Via Pisciarella.\n",
    "\n",
    "After auditing the OSM file and building a list of expected street types only a few errors were found in the street types:\n",
    "- In some situations, \"Prima\" and \"Seconda\" (first and second) were used where Roman numerals were expected.\n",
    "- \"Via\" was found misspelled as \"Viia\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors were removed by mapping the correctings in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "st_name_mapping = {\n",
    "    'Prima': 'I',\n",
    "    'Seconda': 'II',\n",
    "    'viia': 'Via',\n",
    "    'Viia': 'Via'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, other formatting problems were found:\n",
    "- Capitalization was inconsistent.\n",
    "- Street names used abbreviations whose meanings weren't apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correcting capitalzation was made easy by converting the strings to title case. A regular expression was used to ensure that roman numerals were fixed after this step. E.G., \"Iv\" needed to be converted back to \"IV\" after title case was applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abbreviations required more attention. They were handled by building a regular expression that captured the abbreviation along with the immediately following word. This allowed for capturing the context of the abbreviation before making the correction. The full street names were tracked down and used to buid a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "abbreviations = {\n",
    "    \"A. De\": \"Antonio De\",\n",
    "    \"A. S. Novaro\": \"Angelo Silvio Novaro\",\n",
    "    \"B. V. Romano\": \"Beato Vincenzo Romano\",\n",
    "    \"G. Di\": \"Gaspare Di\",\n",

    "    \"S.Agnese\": \"Sant'Agnese\",\n",
    "    \"S.Ignazio\": \"Sant'Ignazio\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final functions for repairing street names and abbreviations are below. Notice that the `update_short_name` function calls the `update_street_name` function to ensure that it has a properly formatted street name before expanding the abbreviation.  "
